        <p>A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of intake
            and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily.
            Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible increased risk in
            pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated by poor study quality, and
            differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.</p>

    <h1 id="types">TYPES</h1>
    <p>Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a genus
        of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to trees.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <b> Type of bean.</b> There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica originates
            from
            Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide. However, it
            is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade, humidity,
            and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to
            grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65-97 degrees
            Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Type of roast.</b> Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a chemical
            change
            that releases the rich aroma and flavor t associate with coffee. They are then cooled and ground for
            brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the roast, lighter the color and
            roasted flavor and the higher its acidity. Dark roasts produce a black bean with little acidity and a bitter
            roasted flavor. The popular French roast is medium-dark.</li>
        <li> <b>Type of grind.</b> A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A fine
            grind is
            used for deeper flavors like espresso, which releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in coffee
            presses.</li>
        <li> <b>Decaffeinated coffee.</b> This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side effects from
            caffeine. The
            two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee is to apply chemical solvents (methylene
            chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas. Both are applied to steamed or soaked beans, which are
            then allowed to dry. The solvents bind to caffeine and both evaporate when the beans are rinsed and/or
            dried. According to U.S. regulations, at least 97% of the caffeine must be removed to carry the
            decaffeinated label, so there may be trace residual amounts of caffeine. Both methods may cause some loss of
            flavor as other naturally occurring chemicals in coffee beans that impart their unique flavor and scent may
            be destroyed during processing.</li>
